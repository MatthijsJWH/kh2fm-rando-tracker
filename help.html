<h3>Left Click</h3><p>The item will become activated, lighting up to full opacity.</p><p>When clicking on a world more than once, if applicable, a number will appear in the bottom right indicating how many visits have been completed. Drive, magic, and summons have similar systems for levels.</p><p>After all visits have been completed, clicking again will either trigger a symbol to appear in the top left, for defeat of the Data Org/Absent Sillhouette fight, or reset the cell back to its original state.</p><p class="footnote">Note: 'Visits' for Atlantica/100 Acre Wood represent not whole world completion but segment completion. That is, song completion for Atlantica (including the tutorial), and pages for 100 Acre Wood.</p><p class="footnote">Note: The counter for Sora's Level will increase in increments of +1 from LV1-15, then +5 from LV15-50 and +10 from LV50-99.</p><h3>Right Click</h3><ul class="definitions"><li><div class="base">Hollow Bastion</div><div class="definition">Defeated Sephiroth</div></li><li><div class="base">Cavern of Remembrance</div><div class="definition">All Chests until 1st Fight, All Chests until 2nd Fight, All Remaining Chests, Cleared Nobody Fights</div></li><li><div class="base">Olympus Coliseum</div><div class="definition">Cleared Pain and Panic Cup, Cerberus Cup, Titan Cup, Goddess of Fate Cup, Hades Paradox Cup</div></li><li><div class="base">Disney Castle</div><div class="definition">Defeated Lingering Will/Terra</div></li><li><div class="base">The World That Never Was</div><div class="definition">Defeated Roxas, Xigbar, Luxord, Sa√Øx, Xemnas</div></li><li><div class="base">100 Acre Wood</div><div class="definition">Torn Page Counter</div></li><li><div class="base">Drive Forms</div><div class="definition">Growth Ability Counter</div></li><li><div class="base">The Three Proofs</div><div class="definition">Obtained Bronze Crown, Silver Crown, Gold Crown</div></li></ul><h3>Middle Click</h3><p>A red cross will be put over the item, intended to be used if a world/item is disabled in the seed.
